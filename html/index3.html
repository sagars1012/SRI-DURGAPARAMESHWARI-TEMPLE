  <h1>Welcome to Kukke Shree Subrahmanya Temple</h1>
  <p><h3><em>Loaction: Temple is at the foot hills of kumara parvatha and along the banks of river Kumara Dhara that is located at sullia in Karnataka, India.</em></h3></p>
  <h1>History :</h1>
  <p><h3><em> There is an exciting story that is related to the Kukke Subrahmanya Temple in Karnataka. According to legends, Lord Kumaraswamy reached the Kumara Parvatha with his brother Ganesh and a few others after having triumphantly killed the demon rulers Tharaka and Shurapadmasura, and their followers in a war. Lord Kumaraswamy was received by Lord Indra and his followers. Since Lord Indra was thrilled and pleased, he requested the Lord to marry his daughter Devasena, to which the Lord gladly agreed. The divine union took place on Margashira Shudha Shashti at Kumara Parvatha, and the couple was blessed by Gods like Brahma, Rudra and others.</h3></em></h3></p>
  <p><h3><em>Lord Kumaraswamy also gave darshan to Vasuki, the Serpent King, who had been performing tapas since many years in the Biladwara caves of Kukke Subrahmanya to avoid the attack of Garuda. When Vasuki prayed to Lord Kumaraswamy to stay with him permanently at that place, the Lord agreed to stay with his 'parama bhakta' forever.</em></h3></p>
  <p><h3><em>It is believed that from that time onwards, the Lord Kumaraswamy has made his spiritual presence in the shrine, accompanied by his wife, Devasena, and Vasuki. Every year, a famous festival is also celebrated on 'Margashira Shuddha Shashti' and special poojas are offered to the Lord.This place is also described as Gupta kshethra.</em></h3></p>
  <p><h3><em>There is no exact historic evidence regarding the period when the temple was built. Mythology and in Skandapurana refers that during 9th – 10th century AD Sri Shankara who wrote “Shankara Vijayam” (in Bhujanga sthotra), the worship of “Bhaje kukke ligam” has been mentioned. And also There is reference to kukke in bunt’s inscription to 9 AD.</em></h3></p>
